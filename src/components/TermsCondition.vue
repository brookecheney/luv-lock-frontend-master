      <h1 class="text-block">Luv Lock. Terms of Service</h1>

      <p class="text">Effective: Oct 9th, 2020</p>


      <p class="text">
        We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our
        relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places
        where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: These Terms do
        indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Luv Lock. So please read them carefully.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        By using Luv Lock you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don’t agree with them, then don’t use the Services.
      </p>


      <h2 class="text-block">1. Who Can Use the Services.</h2>

      <ul class="text">
        <li>
          No one under 18 is allowed to use the Services. By using the Services, you state that:
        </li>
        <li>
          You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and
          regulations.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2 class="text-block">2. Rights We Grant You</h2>

      <p class="text">
        Luv Lock grants you a personal, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and sub-licensable
        license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the
        Services’ benefits in a way that these Terms allow. Any software that we provide you may automatically download
        and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads
        through your device’s settings. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services,
        nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these
        restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.
      </p>


      <h2 class="text-block">3. Rights You Grant Us</h2>

      <p class="text">
      Our Service allows you to upload luv lock post. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that
      content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      For all content you post you grant Luv Lock royalty-free, sub-licensable, and transferable license to host, store,
      use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the
      limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and
      developing new ones. For information about how to tailor who can view your content, please take a look at our
      Privacy Policy
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any
      reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone,
      though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service. We always
      love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them without  compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">4. The Content</h2>

      <p class="text">
      There is zero tolerance for questionable content and/or abusive behavior.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      The content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although Luv Lock reserves
      the right to review or remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not necessarily review all of it. So
      we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services. Through these
      Terms, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content,
      we cannot guarantee that content on the Services, or that our users’ use of our Services, will always conform to
      our Terms or Guidelines.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">5. Privacy</h2>

      <p class="text">
      Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by reading our
      Privacy Policy. We encourage you to give the Privacy Policy a careful look because, by using our Services, you
      agree that Luv lock can collect, use, and share your Luv Lock information consistent with that policy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">6. Respecting Others’ Rights</h2>

      <p class="text">
      Luv Lock respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services, or enable
      anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that:
      </p>

      <ul class="text">
        <li>
          violates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual
      property right.
        </li>
        <li>
          bullies, harasses, or intimidates.
        </li>
        <li>
          defames
        </li>
        <li>
          spams or solicits our users.
        </li>
        <li>
          violate or infringe Luv Locks copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or
      otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes
      without our consent.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text">
      In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorized by these
      Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">7. Respecting Copyright</h2>

      <p class="text">
      Luv Lock honors copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable steps
      to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if Luv Lock becomes
      aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to
      terminate the user’s account.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please report it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">8. Safety</h2>

      <p class="text">
      We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in.
      By using the Services, you agree that:
      </p>

      <ul class="text">
        <li>
          You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the
      Services or extract other user’s information.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content
      or information without our written consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other
      users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of
      the Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not post content that contains or links to pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or
      incitements to violence.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or
      features of the Services that you are not authorized to access.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract
      you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never text and drive.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">9. Data Charges and Mobile Phones</h2>

      <p class="text">
      You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and
      data charges.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">10. Modifying the Services and Termination</h2>

      <p class="text">
      We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove
      features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any
      of these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand. You can terminate
      these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account. Luv Lock may also terminate these Terms with
      you at any time, for any reason, and without advanced notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any
      Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. For example, we may deactivate
      your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Luv Lock continue to be bound by Terms outlined in this
      document.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">11. Indemnity</h2>

      <p class="text">
      You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Luv Lock our affiliates,
      directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints,
      charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out
      of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of
      these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">12. Disclaimers</h2>

      <p class="text">
      We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.
      THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY
      KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
      A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE Luv Lock. ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER
      EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY;
      (B) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT, USER
      CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      Luv Lock TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY
      CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU
      MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF WHICH
      Luv Lock WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">13. Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p class="text">
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, Luv Lock. AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES,
      LICENSORS, AGENTS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
      PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY
      LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY
      TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE
      SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF Luv Lock. HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
      THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL Luv Lock.’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE
      SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID Luv Lock. IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">14. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</h2>

      <p class="text">
      PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND Luv Lock. TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL
      DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      a. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and Luv Lock agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract,
      tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
      use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an
      individual basis, except that you and Luv Lock are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party
      seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets,
      or patents. To be clear: The phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between
      us before the effective date of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      b. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
      dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
      and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, available by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If the
      AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the
      arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these
      Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total
      amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the
      option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more,
      the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
      arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      c. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will
      be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will
      be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the
      parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      d. Fees. If you choose to arbitrate with Luv Lock , you will not have to pay any fees to do so. That is because
      Luv Lock will reimburse you for your filing fee and the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules provide that any hearing
      fees and arbitrator compensation are our responsibility. To the extent another arbitral forum is selected, Luv
      Lock will pay that forum’s fees as well.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      e. Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and
      liabilities, if any, of you and Luv Lock The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined
      with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
      part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any
      non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The
      arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions
      on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
      authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the
      arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Love Lock
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      f. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND Love Lock. WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE
      A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Luv Lock. are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved
      by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules
      applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Luv Lock.
      over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND Luv Lock. WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and
      elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      g. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
      MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER
      OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If,
      however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are
      entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      h. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party
      against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration
      agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      i. Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Luv Lock inc. can force
      the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Luv Lock. in writing no later than 30 days after first
      becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Luv Lock
      username and the email address you used to set up your Luv Lock account (if you have one), and an unequivocal
      statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      j. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or luv lock may bring an individual action in
      small claims court.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      k. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship
      with Luv lock.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">15. Severability</h2>

      <p class="text">
      If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and
      not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">16. Additional Terms for Specific Services</h2>

      <p class="text">
      Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific
      Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the relevant Services, then become
      part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. If any part of those additional terms and conditions
      conflicts with these Terms, the additional terms and conditions will prevail.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-block">17. Final Terms</h2>

      <ul class="text">
        <li>
          These Terms (together with any additional terms applicable to specific Services you use) make up the entire
      agreement between you and Luv Lock, and supersede any prior agreements.
        </li>
        <li>
          These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.
        </li>
        <li>
          We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.
